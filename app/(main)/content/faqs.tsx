    question: "What's the difference between your Basic, Standard, and Premium packages?",
    answer:
      "The key differences lie in scope, complexity, and deliverables. Basic packages provide essential solutions for small businesses or startups with straightforward needs. Standard packages offer more comprehensive solutions with additional features and functionality for growing businesses. Premium packages provide enterprise-level solutions with advanced features, extensive customization, and longer support periods. I recommend reviewing the comparison table to see exactly which features are included in each tier for your specific needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my package later if my needs change?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Many clients start with a Basic or Standard package and upgrade as their business grows. I design all solutions with scalability in mind, making future upgrades seamless. If you start with a Basic website, for example, we can later enhance it with e-commerce functionality or more advanced features. I'll provide a clear upgrade path that builds upon your existing investment rather than requiring a complete rebuild.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer customizations beyond what's listed in the packages?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all packages can be customized to meet your specific requirements. The packages represent common configurations, but I understand every project has unique needs. For Web Development, we can add specific integrations or features. For UI/UX Design, we can include additional screens or user flows. For Graphic Design, we can create additional brand assets. Custom requirements will be quoted separately and added to the base package price.",
  },
  {
    question: "What deliverables will I receive with each package?",
    answer:
      "For Web Development: You'll receive a fully functional website or application, all source code, documentation, and training on content management. For UI/UX Design: You'll receive design files, prototypes, style guides, and all assets in multiple formats. For Graphic Design: You'll receive logo files in various formats, brand guidelines, and all designed assets in both print and digital formats. All packages include the deliverables specified in the package description, with Premium packages offering the most comprehensive set of deliverables.",

  {
    question: "What's your typical timeline for completing projects?",
    answer:
      "Timelines vary based on project complexity and package tier. Basic packages typically take 2-4 weeks, Standard packages 4-8 weeks, and Premium packages 8-12 weeks or more. Web Development projects generally take longer than UI/UX or Graphic Design projects of similar scope. During our initial consultation, I'll provide a detailed timeline specific to your project after understanding all requirements. I pride myself on meeting agreed deadlines while maintaining quality standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do payments work for your packages?",
    answer:
      "I typically require a 50% deposit to begin work, with the remaining 50% due upon project completion. For larger Premium projects, I offer milestone-based payment schedules (e.g., 30% upfront, 30% at midpoint, 40% upon completion). All payment terms are clearly outlined in the project proposal and contract. I accept bank transfers, mobile money, and major credit cards for your convenience.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide ongoing support after project completion?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all packages include a support period (1 month for Basic, 3 months for Standard, 6 months for Premium). During this period, I'll address any issues, make minor adjustments, and answer questions at no additional cost. After this period, I offer monthly maintenance packages or hourly support rates for ongoing needs. For websites, I also offer hosting management and regular updates to ensure security and performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we get started with a project?",
    answer:
      "The process begins with a consultation to discuss your needs and determine the most appropriate package. I'll then provide a detailed proposal outlining scope, deliverables, timeline, and cost. Once approved, I'll send a contract and invoice for the initial payment. After receiving the deposit, I'll begin with a discovery phase to gather detailed requirements before moving into design and development. Throughout the project, you'll receive regular updates and opportunities for feedback.",
